# Flowchart Project Manager

A tiny web application for building project plans as a flowchart. Add tasks and define dependencies to visualize how work flows through a project.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Use the form to enter a task name and optionally choose a dependency. Each submission updates the flowchart diagram displayed below the form.
